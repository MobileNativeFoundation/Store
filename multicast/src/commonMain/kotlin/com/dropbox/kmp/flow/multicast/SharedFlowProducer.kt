/**
 * A flow collector that works with a [ChannelManager] to collect values from an upstream flow
 * and dispatch to the [sendUpsteamMessage] which then dispatches to downstream collectors.
 *
 * They work in sync such that this producer always expects an ack from the [ChannelManager] after
 * sending an event.
 *
 * Cancellation of the collection might be triggered by both this producer (e.g. upstream completes)
 * or the [ChannelManager] (e.g. all active collectors complete).
