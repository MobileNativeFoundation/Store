/**
 *
 * [SourceOfTruth], as name implies, is the persistence API which [Store] uses to serve values to
 * the collectors. If provided, [Store] will only return values received from [SourceOfTruth] back
 * to the collectors.
 *
 * In other words, values coming from the [Fetcher] will always be sent to the [SourceOfTruth]
 * and will be read back via [reader] to be returned to the collector.
 *
 * This round-trip ensures the data is consistent across the application in case the [Fetcher] may
 * not return all fields or return a different class type than the app uses. It is particularly
 * useful if your application has a local observable database which is directly modified by the app
 * as Store can observe these changes and update the collectors even before value is synced to the
 * backend.
 *
 * Source of truth takes care of making any source (no matter if it has flowing reads or not) into
 * a common flowing API.
 *
 * A source of truth is usually backed by local storage. It's purpose is to eliminate the need
 * for waiting on network update before local modifications are available (via [Store.stream]).
 *
 * For maximal flexibility, [writer]'s record type ([Input]] and [reader]'s record type
 * ([Output]) are not identical. This allows us to read one type of objects from network and
 * transform them to another type when placing them in local storage.
 *
 * A source of truth is usually backed by local storage. It's purpose is to eliminate the need
 * for waiting on network update before local modifications are available (via [Store.stream]).
