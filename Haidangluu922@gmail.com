Starter Workflows

These are the workflow files for helping people get started with GitHub Actions. They're presented whenever you start to create a new GitHub Actions workflow.

If you want to get started with GitHub Actions, you can use these starter workflows by clicking the "Actions" tab in the repository where you want to create a workflow.

￼

Directory structure

ci: solutions for Continuous Integration and Deploymentsautomation: solutions for automating workflows.code-scanning: starter workflows for Code Scanningicons: svg icons for the relevant template

Each workflow must be written in YAML and have a .yml extension. They also need a corresponding .properties.json file that contains extra metadata about the workflow (this is displayed in the GitHub.com UI).

For example: ci/django.yml and ci/properties/django.properties.json.

Valid properties

name: the name shown in onboarding. This property is unique within the repository.description: the description shown in onboardingiconName: the icon name in the relevant folder, for example, django should have an icon icons/django.svg. Only SVG is supported at this time. Another option is to use octicon. The format to use an octicon is octicon <<icon name>>. Example: octicon personcreator: creator of the template shown in onboarding. All the workflow templates from an author will have the same creator field.categories: the categories that it will be shown under. Choose at least one category from the list here. Further, choose the categories from the list of languages available here. When a user views the available templates, those templates that match the same language will feature more prominently.

IRS tax related information/2019 Wikimedia Foundation Form 990 Frequently Asked Questions

LanguageWatchEdit

< IRS tax related information

Other languages:

English

Overview

Key HighlightsEdit

The page numbers used are based on the page number in the bottom right corner of each page in the Form 990 PDF.

On page 4, Part I, Summary, line 6 the total number of volunteers is listed as 292,000, where does this number come from?Edit

This number is the estimated number of monthly average editors in the fiscal year of the report.

On page 4, Part I, Summary, line 8, Contributions and grants increased by approximately US$5.1 million from the prior year, what is causing this increase?Edit

Our annual plan budget increased from the prior year and we raised additional funds to meet that commitment. The increase can be partially attributed to the increase in the number of donations, approximately 20.8% more than FY18-19, that resulted from improved performance of our fundraising banners and emails as well as new channels. .

More information on our fundraising activities, it can be found in our Fundraising Report for FY2019-2020 [1].

On page 4, Part I, Summary, line 15, Salaries have increased by approximately US$9.5 million from the prior year, what is causing this increase?Edit

This increase represents the addition of 69 new staff as well as our annual compensation adjustments for existing staff. This is consistent with the growth outline in our approved annual plan to support our programmatic priorities.

The Wikimedia Foundation's compensation practices reflect our desire to compensate people for their work in a manner that is understandable, equitable, reasonable, and consistent with our values and culture. The primary mechanism for compensation is base pay, supported by strong benefits and paid time off allotments, and a commitment to professional development. As a donor funded nonprofit, the Wikimedia Foundation does not provide bonuses.

In setting the salaries for all of our paid positions for the 2019-2020 fiscal year, our Talent & Culture department uses a set of salary ranges specific to job roles and levels which are determined and updated using data from the Mercer salary survey. Mercer Salary Survey. The Board of Trustees also uses this information and comparative data from the Form 990s of other nonprofits organizations when discussing executive salaries. The largely technical and high-skill nature of some of our work requires competitive wages to recruit the best talent and compensate them fairly for their expertise and commitment. We believe that the Wikimedia Foundation continues to pay competitively, but within the average range for comparable organizations and roles.

On page 6, Part IV, line 4 is marked “Yes” for lobbying activities, why?Edit

The IRS defines “lobbying activities” as “all activities intended to influence foreign, national, state, or local legislation.” In the 2019-20 fiscal year, the Wikimedia Foundation continued to support the public policy efforts of the Wikimedia movement, including by engaging in lobbying activities. We have outlined our expenditures on lobbying activities for the fiscal year in Schedule C, pages 24-27.

On page 9, Part VI, Section B, line 10a, the question “Does the organization have local chapters, branches, or affiliates?” is answered “No.” Why?Edit

This question refers to entities that are not their own legal entities but rather extensions of the parent entity, in this case the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikimedia affiliates are independent organizations.

On pages 10-11, Part VII, Section A, there is a list of “current officers” which includes people who are no longer on the the board and staff but does not include current staff. Why?Edit

The list is intended to reflect 2019-20 fiscal year and 2019 calendar year, which means it includes key staff who were present for all, or any part, of the calendar year, as well as board members active during the fiscal year from July 2019 through June 2020.

On page 10, Part VII, Section A, how do you determine which staff are listed here? Why is there a name I don’t recognize?Edit

The requirements for inclusion on this list are staff who are officers of the organization, key employees (who have over $150,000 of reportable compensation) and the five highest compensated employees. The Form 990 is a legal document requiring us to put down the legal names of all reported individuals, which may or may not be the name they use routinely. The Wikimedia Foundation believes their preferred name is their real name, but the federal government of the United States does not always agree.

On page 13, Part IX, line 11b - what does the $2,077,671 in fees for legal services represent?Edit

It relates to general outside legal counsel, trademarks support, human resources related counsel, and litigation. These are recurring activities and consistent with prior years.

On page 13, Part IX, line 25 - How does the expenses allocation among Program Service Expenses, Management and General Expenses and Fundraising Expenses compare to 2018-2019 fiscal year ?Edit

We continue to invest in programmatic activities as outlined in our our approved annual plan. During this reporting period we invested 75% in Program Services, 14% in Management & General, and 11% in Fundraising which shows an increase of 1% in Program Services and a decrease of 1% in Fundraising as compared to FY2018-2019. The standard percentage benchmark for allocation to program services is generally 65%.

On page 31, Schedule D, Part XI, line 2b - what does donated services and use of facilities represent?Edit

This related to pro bono litigation services for the Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA' lawsuit, primarily from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Cooley, LLP, other legal services relating to intellectual property law and internet hosting services.

What is the purpose of Schedule F, Statement of Activities Outside of the United States (begins at page 33)?Edit

This schedule shows what activities the organization has outside of the United States and how much the expenses are related to those activities. Furthermore, the IRS asks us to break the activities down by region; for example, North America includes Canada and Mexico (but not the U.S. since this schedule is focusing outside of the U.S.), East Asia and the Pacific includes Australia, South Asia includes India. Expenses include payments for services such as bandwidth, contractors, grants to organizations and individuals, etc. The IRS also asks about Fundraising activities. Through our online donations, we receive donations from every region that the IRS lists. We don't show expenses in those regions related to Fundraising because we do not pay individuals or organizations to fundraise in regions outside of the U.S.

Variables - We use variables the same way we use reusables. Variables are for short strings of reusable text.

Liquid - We use liquid helpers to create different versions of our content.

Scripts - The scripts directory is the home for all of the scripts you can run locally.

Tests - We use tests to ensure content will render correctly on the site. Tests run automatically in your PR, and sometimes it's also helpful to run them locally.

Reviewing

We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

💛 Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.
💛 Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.
💛 Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

 Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one). Compare your pull request's source changes to staging to confirm that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This helps spot issues like typos, content that doesn't follow the style guide, or content that isn't rendering due to versioning problems. Remember that lists and tables can be tricky. Review the content for technical accuracy. Review the entire pull request using the localization checklist. Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide. Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct. If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

Pull request template

When you open a pull request, you must fill out the "Ready for review" template before we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.

Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:

Regular Expressions: Windows uses \r\n for line endings, while Unix based systems use \n. Therefore when working on Regular Expressions, use \r?\n instead of \n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.Paths: Windows systems use \ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix, path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash.Filename too long error: There is a 260 character limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could possibly cause other issues, a few workarounds include:Shorten the path by cloning this repo directly into C:\Use a different Git client on WindowsUpdate Git configuration: git config --system core.longpaths true
