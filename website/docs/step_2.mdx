### Overview
- Take a look at the `shared` module. This is where we will be writing our shared code. A few notes:
- Take a look at the `android` module. This is where we will be writing our Android code.
- Take a look at the `ios` module. This is where we will be writing our iOS code.
- Take a look at the `tooling` module. This is where our tooling code is located.

### Dependencies

```yaml
- store  # KMP data loading and caching
- buildkonfig  # KMP build config
- kotlin-inject  # KMP dependency injection
