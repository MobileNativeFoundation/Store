# Store Fundamentals in 30 Minutes

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will build a news app using Store. Our goal is to create a reliable and efficient mobile app that handles data well. Store is a tool for managing data fetching and caching. It ensures that users can access news articles quickly, even when offline.

The app we're building will mirror the functionality shown in the design mocks above. It will be simple: pulling news data from a remote source, caching it, and displaying it to users. As we go through the steps, you will learn to implement Store to handle data loading and storage.

You will see how Store can streamline the process of building a data-centric application. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand the core principles of using the Store library in a mobile app, setting a foundation for further development and learning. Let's begin.

## Prerequisites
- Knowledge of Kotlin
- Android Studio or IntelliJ installed
- Familiarity with Jetpack Compose

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Project
Open your IDE and create a new project. Name it "StoreNewsApp". Ensure the target platform is correctly set for either Android or iOS.

## Step 2: Adding Dependencies
For Android, add Store library dependencies in build.gradle. For iOS, add Store via CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager. Sync your project after adding.

## Step 3: Creating Data Models
Define a NewsArticle class with properties such as title, description, and imageUrl. These models represent the articles in the app.

## Step 4: Implementing Networking
Set up the networking layer. Use Retrofit for Android or URLSession for iOS. Write functions to fetch news articles from a mock API endpoint.

## Step 5: Integrating Store
Create a NewsStore by extending the Store class. Configure it to fetch, cache, and return NewsArticle objects. Use the networking functions you wrote for data fetching.

## Step 6: Building the UI
Design the main screen using RecyclerView for Android or UICollectionView for iOS. Create item views for articles that display the title and image.

## Step 7: Fetching and Displaying Data
In the main activity or view controller, initialize NewsStore. Fetch articles and observe changes. Update the UI accordingly when data is fetched or updated.

## Step 8: Handling User Interaction
Implement pull-to-refresh to reload articles. When users trigger refresh, the Store should fetch new data and update the cache.

## Step 9: Running and Testing
Run the app in an emulator or on a device. Check if articles are fetched, cached, and displayed. Ensure pull-to-refresh updates articles.

## Step 10: Exploring Advanced Store Features
If time permits, look into Store's advanced features like Stream for real-time updates or explore different caching strategies provided by the library.

Conclusion
You now have a basic yet functional news app. The Store library is handling data operations seamlessly. Use this foundation to expand into a more robust application.

Remember, this app is a starting point. The Store library is capable of handling more complex scenarios which you can explore as you become more familiar with its features.
